# tidbeck's dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles, probably only useful for me.

## Install instructions

* Clone the repo to your home folder
* Install [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
* Install the dotfiles e.g. `stow nvim`

[More information](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) on why and how to use _stow_ for managaging your dotfiles.
